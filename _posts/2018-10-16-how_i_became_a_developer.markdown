Well, my wife is just full of great ideas. One of them was the impetus for me to eventually fall in love with coding and change my life and career.

`tuz['career'][0] = "Pianist"`<br>
`tuz['career'][0]['jobs'] = ["Audition pianist", "Piano bar performer", "Musical director", "Arranger", "Synth programmer", "Cabaret Accompanist", "Bandleader"`]

Coding is my second career. My first, the job I've been doing my whole adult life, is music. I'm a professional keyboardist, doing anything from conducting and playing in the pit a musical, to rocking out playing Michael Jackson covers in my wedding band, to taking requests at a piano bar. That last one is where this all starts.

I play regularly at Georgetown Piano Bar here in DC, and I always bring a printed list songs to give the audience ideas of songs to request.

`tuz['song_list'].max < 200     // true` <br>
`tuz['songs'].count > 1000     // true`

Only about 200 songs fit on a page, but I know, or can pull up in my library, something like 1000 songs. One night my wife (then my girlfriend) said wouldn't it be great if people could have an app where they could **see all my songs** and even **make requests from their phone**.

Brilliant idea, Holly! 

`if current_year < 2018`<br>
`  tuz['girlfriend'] = "Holly"`<br>
`else`<br>
`  tuz['wife'] = "Holly"`<br>
`  tuz['girlfriend'] = nil `<br>
`end`

Time passed, maybe a year. I had done a little bit of programming in the past – I'd been a big qBasic dork in my middle school years – and I thought the app was a great idea and that maybe one day I'd learn to make it. When Apple's Spring 2016 keynote talked at length about learning to code, about Swift, and about the upcoming Swift Playgrounds app, I decided that it was time.

I downloaded a bunch of "learn Swift" apps, but progressed slowly. They all seemed to teach and reteach the same basics of the language: arithmetic operators, assignment, `if` statements and `for` and `while` loops, function definitions. This was stuff I remembered somewhat from my qBasic days (20 years or so earlier), and honestly wasn't all that interesting. Plus the apps were mostly structured as multiple choice questions and didn't give me much of an experience of coding. I eventually bought the "Mastering Swift" series by Kevin J. McNeish which was finally an in for me into the Apple APIs that allow you to actually make apps. 

`if current_year > 2009 && current_year < 2016 `<br>
`tuz['home'] = "Washington, DC"`<br>
`elsif current_year == 2016 || current_year == 2017`<br>
`  tuz['home'] = "Nowhere and everywhere"`<br>
`end`

By the time the Swift Playgrounds app was released, Holly and I had embarked on a crazy adventure: we quit our jobs, rented out our houses, found a friend to care for our cat, and travelled around the world for 9 months. 

`the_trip['locations'] = ["Ireland", "England", "France", "Spain", "Greece", "Turkey", "Thailand", "Cambodia", "Indonesia", "Hong Kong", "Japan", "Bulgaria", "Austria", "Hungary", "Italy"]`

This gave me plenty of time to indulge my new interest in coding, and to play around a lot with Swift Playgrounds. My real education started when I started following Stanford University's iOS Development course on iTunesU. That's when I became obsessed. 

`itunes_store['jonathan_tuzman'].apps = ["Basic FreeCell", "Your Piano Bar"]`

One year, two iOS apps, and a few languages later, I decided that I loved coding as much as I'd always loved music, and that I wanted to make it my career. The prospect of a career that actually included full-time reliable ongoing employment (unlike music, for the most part) was appealing, the prospect of being able to afford to only *take* music gigs without having to *get* gigs was very exciting, but the idea of being able to code all day every day, well that was just the best.

And here I am at Flatiron! The financial equation is a little different than a coding job (I pay them rather than they pay me!) but I get to code all day, and soon enough I look forward to getting my first job in software development.

I'll keep you posted as I continue to learn and create!
